Drawing from the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum's collection, Acquiring Design visualizes the ongoing development of its collection and relationships between objects. By presenting the collection as a series of object-relationships over time, the project attempts to uncover trends across mediums, geography, designers, and museum departments.
